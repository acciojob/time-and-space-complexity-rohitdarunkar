<h1>Time and Space complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how the running time of an algorithm grows with input size, while space complexity measures how the memory usage grows.</p>
<p><b>Space complexity O(n)</b> measures how much memory an algorithm requires as the input size increases.</p>
