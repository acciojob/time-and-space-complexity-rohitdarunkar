<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity describes how efficient an algorithm is by measuring how its execution time grows with input size.</p>
<p><b>Space Complexity</b> explains the amount of memory an algorithm uses, such as O(n) space where memory grows linearly with input size.</p>
